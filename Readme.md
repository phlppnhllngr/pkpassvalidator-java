# pkpassvalidator-java
This is a Java program that validates pkpass-files.<br>
The validation code was mostly taken from <https://github.com/tomasmcguinness/pkpassvalidator> (üôè) and converted to Java.<br>
Unlike @tomasmcguinness' repository, this one does not include any server code.<br>
There is just one `main` method that expects a path to a pkpass file as input, prints the validation result to the console and exits with code 1 when there is a validation error.

## Compile
```
mvn clean package
```

## Run
Pass a valid `java.nio.file.Path` to the main method.<br>
Example (Windows):
```
java --class-path "target\pkpassvalidator-java-1.0.0.jar;target\lib\*" phlppnhllngr.pkpassvalidator.Main "C:\path\to\some.pkpass" 
```
